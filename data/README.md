# Data set for estimating the precise number of occupants in a room using multiple non-intrusive environmental sensors like temperature, light, sound, CO2 and PIR.

This dataset associated with an article, attached in the documents, 
gives information (physical or biological data) collected from sensors every 30 seconds in a room. 
The aim is to use this data to assess the number of people present in the room, from 0 to 3 : the room occupancy. 
The target variable of classification problem is therefore the data noted “Room_Occupancy_Count”.

## Read the dataset description carefully:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/864/room+occupancy+estimation .

You can read and be inspired by the associated article in which methods are compared, including a random forest model. 
You can use the classification method of your choice and test a regression.

P.S.: note that in this dataset, a sample can be identified by the date, time and second of the reading 
(i.e. the unique pair of “Date” and “Time” variables in the dataset).
